# Keras: Deep Learning Material

Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow), [CNTK](https://github.com/Microsoft/cntk), or [Theano](https://github.com/Theano/Theano). It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. *Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to doing good research.*

Use Keras if you need a deep learning library that:

- Allows for easy and fast prototyping (through user friendliness, modularity, and extensibility).
- Supports both convolutional networks and recurrent networks, as well as combinations of the two.
- Runs seamlessly on CPU and GPU.

Read the documentation at [Keras.io](https://keras.io).

Keras is compatible with: __Python 2.7-3.6__.


# How to install keras

* First install python3.7 using Anaconda
* second step is to run the command in annaconda CLI "pip install keras"
* third step to to run the command in annaconda CLI "pip install tensorflow"
* fourth step is to  run the command in annaconda CLI "pip install theano"
